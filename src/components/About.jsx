            <h1>Hi, my name is Abdullah Naeem</h1>
            <p> I am a Data Science graduate from Simon Fraser University with a passion in data analysis and 
                transforming data into actionable business insights</p>
            <p> Through my experience working with Statistics Canada and my degree capstone project, 
                I’ve gained experience in developing data pipelines, optimizing model performance, and generating business recommendations 
                that inform key strategic decisions. I excel in team-based environments, as demonstrated by my role as an Events Director for SFU's Data Science Student Society 
                where I organized events and hackathons on campus, helping to strengthen community engagement and enhance learning opportunities for other students. 
                I’m eager to continue expanding my skills and apply Data Science to solve real-world problems that drive strategic decision-making.</p>
